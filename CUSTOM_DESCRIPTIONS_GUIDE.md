# 📝 Custom Portfolio Descriptions Guide

## 🎯 How to Add Custom Descriptions

I've fixed the duplicate images issue and created an easy system for adding custom descriptions to your portfolio images!

## 🔧 Two Ways to Manage Portfolio

### **Option 1: Automatic (Simple)**
- Just add images to `static/images/portfolio/`
- Automatic titles and descriptions are generated
- Perfect for quick updates

### **Option 2: Custom Descriptions (Professional)**
- Add images to `static/images/portfolio/`
- Add custom descriptions in `data/portfolio_descriptions.json`
- Full control over titles, descriptions, and categories

## 📝 Adding Custom Descriptions

### **Step 1: Edit the Descriptions File**
Open: `data/portfolio_descriptions.json`

### **Step 2: Add Your Custom Content**
```json
{
  "job1": {
    "title": "Durban North Residence",
    "description": "Complete 5000L water backup system installation for a family home in Durban North. This project included a Jojo tank, Grundfos pump system, pressure switch, and full automation.",
    "category": "residential"
  },
  "job2": {
    "title": "Westville Family Home", 
    "description": "Professional installation of a 2500L Eco tank system for a growing family in Westville. The system features level indicators and overflow protection.",
    "category": "residential"
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Key Rules**
- **Key name**: Use filename without extension (e.g., `job1` for `job1.jpg`)
- **Title**: Custom title for the project
- **Description**: Detailed description of the work done
- **Category**: Either `"residential"` or `"commercial"`

## 🎨 Example Descriptions

### **Residential Project**
```json
"durban-north-5000L": {
  "title": "Durban North 5000L Installation",
  "description": "Large capacity water backup system for a family of 6. Installed 5000L Jojo tank with Grundfos SB 5-45 pump, complete automation, and level monitoring. Project completed in 6 hours with full testing and customer training.",
  "category": "residential"
}
```

### **Commercial Project**
```json
"ballito-shopping-center": {
  "title": "Ballito Shopping Center",
  "description": "Commercial-grade water backup solution for busy retail complex. Multiple 2500L tanks with redundant pump systems, emergency backup, and 24/7 monitoring. Serves 15 retail units with zero downtime during installation.",
  "category": "commercial"
}
```

### **Maintenance Project**
```json
"pump-upgrade-pmb": {
  "title": "Pump System Upgrade - PMB",
  "description": "Complete pump system upgrade and maintenance service in Pietermaritzburg. Replaced aging pump with new Grundfos unit, updated pressure switches, and optimized system for improved efficiency and reliability.",
  "category": "maintenance"
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### **With Custom Description:**
1. Image: `job1.jpg` in portfolio folder
2. Description: `job1` entry in JSON file
3. **Result**: Uses your custom title and description

### **Without Custom Description:**
1. Image: `job3.jpg` in portfolio folder
2. No `job3` entry in JSON file
3. **Result**: Uses automatic title "Project 3" and generic description

## 📁 File Structure

```
data/
└── portfolio_descriptions.json    # Your custom descriptions

static/images/portfolio/
├── job1.jpg                      # Your images

└── job3.jpg
```
